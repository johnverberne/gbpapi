# GroenBatenPlanner

The Green Benefit Planner is an instrument that can be used to substantiate or support decisions about spatial planning. The tool calculates the effects of spatial planning on natural capital. This helps policy makers to make choices in urban development.
The tool uses the Natural Capital Model for this. This model uses maps as the basis for model calculations of different types of benefit/ecosystem services, such as a land use map, a population map and vegetation maps.
This part of the software is the API that acts as the interface with the model calculation and the internet through a API.
GroenBatenPlanner consists of several products, each aimed at a specific one user task.
